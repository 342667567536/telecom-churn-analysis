# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 📞

## 📌 Executive Summary
This project analyzes telecom customer data to identify key drivers of churn. [cite_start]My analysis reveals that **over 26% of customers have churned** [cite: 11][cite_start], with the highest risk identified among new users and those on month-to-month contracts[cite: 11].

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* [cite_start]**Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, Numpy) [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Sheets [cite: 7]

## 🔍 Key Findings
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified three primary "clues" driving customer loss:

1.  [cite_start]**The Monthly Contract Trap:** Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn[cite: 39]. [cite_start]Customers on Month-to-Month plans leave at a significantly higher rate than those on long-term contracts[cite: 40].
2.  [cite_start]**Payment Friction:** Users paying via **Electronic Check** have a much higher churn rate compared to those using automated credit card or bank transfers[cite: 54].
3.  [cite_start]**High-Risk Demographics:** * **New Users:** Customers in the 0-12 month tenure group make up 31% of the base and have the highest turnover[cite: 32].
    * [cite_start]**Senior Citizens:** Churn rates are visibly higher for Senior Citizens compared to younger customers[cite: 68].

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the data, the following actions are recommended to increase retention:
* [cite_start]**Incentivize Long-term Commitment:** Offer discounts to transition month-to-month users to 1-year plans[cite: 26, 79].
* [cite_start]**Streamline Payments:** Nudge users toward automatic Credit Card payments to avoid issues associated with "Electronic Checks"[cite: 27, 80].
* [cite_start]**Targeted Support:** Launch a "Welcome Program" specifically for new sign-ups and Senior Citizens to provide support during the critical first 12 months[cite: 28, 81].
